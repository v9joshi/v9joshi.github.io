<p>For my graduate research I worked at the <a class="reference external" href="https://movement.osu.edu">movement lab</a>. A brief description of my work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using trajectory optimization on simple models of bipedal walking to study human-structure interactions.</li>
<li>Developing simple feedback controlled models of bipedal walking to study human-structure interactions.</li>
<li>Experimentally studying human response to perturbations.</li>
<li>Deriving simple feedback controllers for biped models using data from human experiments.</li>
</ul>
