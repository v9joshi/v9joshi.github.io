</div><p>Humans can choose to walk in whatever manner they want to (as demonstrated by the Monty Python skit above), yet everyone seems to walk in about the same way. <a class="reference external" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&amp;q=energy+minimization+in+human+locomotion">Predictive theories for human locomotion can explain the steady state</a>, but have not yet explained how we keep ourselves from falling down. We would like to expand our predictive theories by asking how do humans respond to pushes and pulls in a way that keeps them stable?</p>
<p><strong>What we did:</strong></p>
<p>We conducted human subject experiments where we had people walk on a treadmill while cables connected at their pelvis were used to pull them far away from their normal walking pattern. We then observed how these subjects coordinated their limbs to keep themselves from falling and eventually return to their normal walking pattern. This data was then used for two things:</p>

</div><p>It is well known that pedestrians walking across a bridge can shake the bridge up and down, this is why on many footbridges there are signs instructing marchers to break step. What is less known however, is that pedestrians can shake bridges side to side as well. The opening day of the London Millennium Bridge was a famous example of this phenomenon (as seen in the video above). <a class="reference external" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&amp;q=lateral+excitation+of+bridges">Many studies of this phenomenon</a> have suggested that crowd synchrony is the root cause, but does our understanding of human walking behaviour support this hypothesis?</p>
<p><strong>What we did:</strong></p>
<p>We made computer simulations of pedestrians walking on shaky bridges and shaken treadmills. The walking pattern for these simulated people was decided using theories that best explain why real people walk the way they do:</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Minimizing energy costs predicts that shaking bridges can decrease the cost of walking below normal.
However, it takes roughly 800 people walking together for such walking gaits to shake a bridge.</li>
