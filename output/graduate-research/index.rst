For my graduate research I worked at the `movement lab <https://movement.osu.edu>`_. A brief description of my work:


* Using trajectory optimization on simple models of bipedal walking to study human-structure interactions.

* Developing simple feedback controlled models of bipedal walking to study human-structure interactions.

* Experimentally studying human response to perturbations.

* Deriving simple feedback controllers for biped models using data from human experiments.
