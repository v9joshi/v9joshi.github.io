My name is Varun Joshi, I am a graduate of the PhD program in mechanical Engineering at the Ohio State University. During my graduate studies, I worked with  `Prof. Manoj Srinivasan <https://movement.osu.edu/>`_. My research was focused on studying human walking stability and human-structure interaction using computational and experimental methods. In addition to my dissertation research, I've worked on small projects for various courses and for my own entertainment. Details about these projects can be found in the projects section.


I am currently looking for industrial or academic research positions focused on working with robots, prostheses or exoskeletons.
